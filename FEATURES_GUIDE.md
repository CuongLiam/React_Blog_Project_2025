## 🔄 User Flow

1. **View All Posts** → Click "All my posts" tab
2. **My Posts Page** → Click "ADD NEW ARTICLE"
3. **Add Article Form** → Fill form and submit
4. **Success** → Redirected back to My Posts
5. **Edit** → Click "Edit post" on any article (currently styled only)

## 📝 Current Limitations (For Future Enhancement)

1. **Edit Functionality** - "Edit post" button is styled but not functional yet
2. **Delete Functionality** - No delete option yet
3. **Image Upload** - File upload UI is ready but doesn't actually upload (needs backend)
4. **Current User** - Hardcoded as userId = 1 (needs authentication)
5. **Data Persistence** - Articles are stored in memory only (resets on refresh)

## 🚀 Next Steps to Add Real Functionality

### To make "Edit post" work:
1. Create an `EditArticle.tsx` page (similar to AddArticle)
2. Add route `/edit-article/:id`
3. Pre-fill form with existing article data
4. Update article in state/backend on submit

### To add Delete:
1. Add delete button/icon on article cards
2. Show confirmation modal
3. Remove article from state/backend
4. Refresh the list

### To integrate with backend:
1. Replace `fakeData.ts` with API calls
2. Use `fetch()` or `axios` to POST new articles
3. GET articles from `/api/users/:userId/articles`
4. PUT to update, DELETE to remove

## 💡 Tips

- All navigation is working properly
- You can test the flow by clicking around
- The form validates required fields
- Images show placeholder for now
- Pagination works automatically based on article count
